# Cheapest-Flights
There are n cities connected by some number of flights. We are given an array flights where flights[i] = [from, to, price] indicates that there is a flight.
We are also given three integers src(city from which we are flying), dest(city where we have to reach) and k(minimum number of stops), returns the cheapest price from src to dest with almost k stops.
